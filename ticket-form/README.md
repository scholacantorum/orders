# Schola Cantorum Ticket Order Form

On the Schola Cantorum public web site, any page that sells event tickets has a
`<script>` element at the point where the ticket purchase button should appear.
That script element invokes this Vue component, and specifies the products to be
sold through the ticket purchase button.

```html
<script src="https://orders.scholacantorum.org/ticket-form?product=ticket-2019-07-08"></script>

This form is invoked by the Schola Cantorum public web site, through a
`<script>` tag.
